3. Task Filtering: Allow users to filter tasks based on their status (completed or incomplete).
4. Task Deletion: Users can delete individual tasks or remove all tasks at once using a delete button.
5. Local Storage: Store the tasks in the browser's local storage so that they persist between sessions.
6. Responsive Design: Ensure the application is fully responsive and works well across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

 Technologies Used

1. HTML:
   - Provides the structure for the web page, including the input fields, buttons, and lists used in the to-do list.

2. CSS:
   - Styles the web page to create a visually appealing interface.
   - Implements gradients, shadows, and hover effects to enhance the user experience.
   - Utilizes responsive design principles to ensure the app looks good on all devices.

3. JavaScript:
   - Handles the logic for adding, updating, deleting, and filtering tasks.
   - Uses the DOM API to dynamically manipulate the HTML elements based on user interactions.
   - Manages the local storage to persist tasks between sessions.
   - Adds event listeners to capture user inputs and actions like clicking buttons or pressing keys.

4. Font Awesome:
   - Used for including icons like the plus button for adding tasks and the times button for deleting tasks.

5. Local Storage (Browser):
   - Allows for saving the list of tasks in the user's browser so that the data remains even after the browser is closed and reopened.

6. Images/SVGs:
   - Used for visual elements like checkmarks for completed tasks or empty state images when there are no tasks.
